##Keeping Focused##

**15 July 2013 – Sydney, Australia**

I’ve always found it difficult to focus on any task. Interestingly enough, I never took any notice of it up until university. In hind sight, I always assumed, beginning from high school that this lack of focus was due to the very boring  and menial nature of the task, but I eventually found out that even performing tasks and activities that really engaged my interest was resulting in the same outcome. But why???

On most occasions, lacking in focus never really affected my performance as a student, due in part by the fact that I had long enough deadlines, which meant that I always had sufficient time to understand what was needed to be done to complete these tasks. Also, because the very idea of having set an end date for completion motivated me to finish off the activity. Now, sometimes these things never worked out as planned, and one of those times arrived during a period which would hit me like a brick.

During my final year of engineering at university, it was the task of every student to pursue a thesis project (like many other institutions) for their honours year. Following suit, I began to research a topic of interest and started speaking with potential supervisors for my project the year before. As you would imagine, one whole year to prepare for a project was something that I was definitely not familiar with. I did what I did because I wanted to make sure I had enough time to do everything that was needed and also manage my thesis with a full study load during the same year. I felt like I was doing everything right, in the right mind and maybe a bit too ambitious in assuming I would be finished by mid-year. I had chosen my project along with my supervisor and things were looking good. Semester (and my penultimate year) had finished and holidays were imminent. I was pretty excited. I developed a project proposal, created a nice a looking schedule and most importantly made a self-pledge to start work during the summer break. Safe to say, I managed to a do a bit of work during the first couple weeks of break, but boy was it tough. Not having the daily routine of uni, the endless sunshine and no deadline to meet meant that productivity was low, very low. Too many times where I got side-tracked and too often did I postpone even the simplest things. By the end of the break, I had not achieved as much as I had set out to do. This severely meant that everything was pushed back. My final year of uni was about to get a whole lot more busier than I anticipated. The long and the short of it was that by the end of my final year, my body had been plagued by sleepless nights testing hardware, writing code and the thesis report – all of which could have been averted if I didn’t leave almost everything to the last minute.

Looking back, the question I asked myself was – why was I so complacent when it came to completing tasks? I had all the time in the world, I knew what was to be done, but something inside of me was saying no! – take a break and relax. You’ll do it later.

After reflecting on past events for quite some time, I came to discover six key things which for me, could suggest hindered my productivity:

**1. Motivation**

**2. Time**

**3. Task overload**

**4. Task difficulty**

**5. Interest**

**6. Tiredness**

###Motivation###

Your levels of motivation change over time. They can be fairly steady with a few peaks and troughs, but sometimes it can be a sort of rollercoaster ride. As such, task productivity and completion is, I believe, highly dependent on this motivation. I knew that when my motivation was high, I finished tasks in more or less 50 – 75% of the time allocated. However when they were low, it was all about cramming!

###Time###

The outlook of time when the task begins can seem very attractive. I use to always say to myself that I had plenty of time before it was due. “It’s alright, I’ll get to it later”. The more time I had, the more likely it was for me to postpone it until it really mattered. But in fact, it matters as soon as you’re given the task, whether it be from yourself or someone else.

###Task Overload###

I found that when I had too many tasks to complete, it was challenging to focus on one particular task completely, knowing that I had another 4 things to do. Maybe it was just me, but I got the feeling that my mind was in 4 places at once….or maybe I’m just a guy. But in any case, because of these other activities, I found myself drifting  in between, not knowing how much effort was to be allocated and which ultimately chewed into task time.

###Task Difficulty###

In some cases the nature of the task can be quite overwhelming, especially when your knowledge or skill-set on the topic of the activity isn’t at the level it should be. This was very much the case during my internships throughout university. I sort of felt that I wasn’t capable to perform the task and thus procrastinated and pondered on what I should do.

###Interest###

Going through uni, there were always times where I had to do particular subjects because it was mandatory. And it was during those subjects where my interests didn’t really align. Having interest in anything that you undertake will dramatically affect its completion date as well as the quality of that activity.

###Tiredness###

After experiencing too many sleepless nights, I became fully aware of the ramifications of not having enough rest. Feeling tired will not only make you feel like crap but make you do stupid things. Concentration, focus, productivity and the rest of it all goes down.

I don’t know why I didn’t discover any of this earlier. Perhaps it was because I was too oblivious to reflect on my own thoughts or maybe it was because I just didn’t have time to do anything about it with all that was going on around me. But in any case, it was definitely a good thing that I was able to find out what was causing this lack of focus.

Okay, I’ve identified the problems, but what was I going to do about them.

Starting out my career as a graduate engineer really gave me a huge opportunity to experience working in a project based company. It also provided me with the motivation and drive to complete tasks on a timely basis. A project oriented company meant that work was to be done by a specific date, and it also meant that any delay in sub-tasks would result in subsequent delays on a deliverable. All of this meant there was no time to procrastinate. I now occupied a position where I was not performing activities for the sole benefit of myself, but for the welfare of the project and its members. It was a team effort. I needed to pick up my game.

So having found out what was causing all of these problems  and of course not embarrass myself in front of my team and the project, I came up with some really simple techniques that helped me get a better handle on the issues I noted earlier.
Techniques

**Motivation**

Trying to psyche yourself up to get motivated about something isn’t the most easiest thing in the world. If the task isn’t motivating you, look beyond the activity. That is, by finishing the task earlier, you’ll have more time to do other things that you enjoy – grab that early mark off work, have a nice lunch, go for a jog or even look forward to rewarding yourself for completing the activity. All of these things can help you finish that task that little bit earlier than expected.

**Time**

Don’t get deceived by the length of time you may have. It’s an illusion. Get on it as soon as possible. One technique is to set goals or milestones for your task with dates prior to the completion date and ensure you attempt to complete them in advance. Having only one end date puts you into a false sense of security and you naturally will be inclined to seriously begin working on the activity 75% of the way into the defined period. Tip: Keep at it on a regular basis.

**Task Overload**

It’s only natural that we all get inundated at times with more than a handful of things to do. So the last thing you want is to stress or get complacent with what needs to be done. Prioritize your tasks accordingly on some form of to-do list (paper, phone, email etc.). Next, decompose your tasks into sub-tasks and prioritise. In other words – Divide and Conquer. Breaking things down really help and allows you to see the whole activity and its constituents. Doing small things regularly is better than doing everything in a single go. As you go along completing each little sub-task, tick it off. If you decide to tackle multiple tasks, split your time appropriately based on their priority.

**Task Difficulty**

Not knowing what do to or at the very least not knowing how to approach the task can be very daunting. “How do I do this?”, “Where do I start?”, “WTF I have no idea what I’m suppose to be doing”, are the thoughts that will cross your mind at least once. Firstly, don’t panic or stress. Just don’t. It’s the last thing you want. Try to think logically and systematically about what needs to be done. The questions you should be asking are;

- What do I need to know in order to get this done?
- Do I have the skills and knowledge to get it done? If not, what steps do I have to take?
- How long will it take to get done?
- Can I ask anyone for help? Don’t be afraid to ask. People will help you.
- Can I break it down into sub-tasks? Hint Hint.

If you can answer all these questions, you’ve done quite a lot already. Be mindful that sometimes challenging tasks are given to you for a reason – To help you learn and improve yourself. So don’t get frustrated and angry. Take it on the chin and go for it. Completing these tasks will pay off through recognition, merit and satisfaction.

**Interest**

Sometimes you just don’t want to do the task because it just doesn’t interest you. Maybe your boss has passed it on to you, a colleague has asked you to them a favour etc. Whatever it is, sometimes you just can’t run walk away from it, and so you shouldn’t. It’s not easy trying to find an interest in something you dislike, but if you change the way you think, it can have a significant impact on how you approach the task. Try to find an aspect of the activity that you would like to learn about. If it’s something you’ve never done before, take the initiative to learn it. It could be to your benefit in the future.

**Tiredness**

Get enough rest. Try to stick to a sleep routine and make sure you get some exercise. Staying at your desk, at home or in one spot in general for a long time can be detrimental. Take a breather and get out and stretch your legs. Take a stroll around work, go for a run during or after work, whatever. Maintaining a healthy lifestyle is key to productivity. Don’t believe me – try it!

So there you have it. These techniques are far from exhausted and by no means applicable to everyone, but it does give some sense and a little bit of an insight into the reasons we all procrastinate and lack focus in our lives. No one method can solve these issues, but should be more of a collective effort of methods. So next time you find that you’re lacking a little focus, just reflect for a while begin to understand its cause, and it may help you in more ones than one.

Until next time…
