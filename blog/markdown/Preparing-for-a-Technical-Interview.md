##Preparing for a Technical Interview##

**18 July 2013 – Sydney, Australia**

I thought I would give a go at writing a post for those interested in finding out what goes down in a technical interview. This is meant for everyone, but I guess it would be more beneficial to those who may potentially experience one for themselves and maybe help you guys land that dream job!

They called me up for an interview….now what?

The interview process maybe very similar or completely different between places, depending on where you apply and what role you’re applying for. If the company or organisation (I’ll use these interchangeably) is involved in quite a bit of technical design work and complex systems, and in addition you’re applying for an engineering role, chances are that they are going for someone with a bit of technical skills and knowledge under their belt.

If you happen to get a call for an interview – YES! Congrats! So what’s next…

Okay, it’s now time to prepare. Now, for some places they may tell you up front about what to expect in the interview process, but for others they won’t. So if you ask nicely they may give you hints, but don’t let that put you into a false sense of security. Prepare for anything and everything.

The first thing I did was to do a little bit more research about the role I was applying for as well as the company. Remember, I found that no matter how technically capable you are, if you don’t know sh*t about the place or the role, just don’t expect to get the job. Simple as that. You need to show that you’ve done your research as well as demonstrate a desire to work at the organisation. Apart from having the skills, you need to be the right fit for the place, because there’s a good chance you’ll be working in a team environment. So the last thing recruiters want is to hire someone who cannot get along with their teammates.

Alright, so you’ve done the research, now what about the technical part?

Depending on where you apply, the technical bit can be different including but not limited to:

###1. Psychometric Testing###

This is where you typically are given a test with a series of questions that assess various parts of your general thinking. Think of it as a sort of IQ test. Areas covered may include, data interpretation and analysis, shapes, patterns, arithmetic, short answers etc.

I personally am not a big fan of this type of assessment mainly because it doesn’t really determine your capability as a potential employee. It assesses your ability to an extent, but doesn’t account for your interaction with others let alone your potential to fulfill the role.

I’ve heard people say that you can’t really prepare for such a test, but I think you can. Like with any exam, you can prepare for it through a bit of studying. Do online exams, there are plenty out there. Practice Practice Practice, and also time yourself. Also, do the exam under real-life conditions, whatever that means.

###2. Brain Teasers / Puzzles###

Technical recruiters absolutely love these (esp. Google from what I’ve heard amongst friends). They give you questions from left field and expect you to solve it, typically using a pen and paper.

I find that these sort of questions are a good means to test your analytical ability to solve complex problems and it’s definitely something worth preparing for when applying for a technical position. I also find from past experience, that it doesn’t really matter so much on your answer (but it does sort of count for something if you also get it correct), they place more attention on your ability to solve the problem – Your thought process. Speaking aloud helps. It places the recruiters in your position. Be mindful that most of the time the interviewers are also technical people i.e. engineers etc. so they probably were once in your shoes in a past life. Don’t be afraid to let them know how you feel.

Preparing for these sort of questions can be a bit daunting at first, so best to get a head start A.S.A.P. once you get the call. There are plenty of questions available on the net. And don’t forget to practice.

Tip: Breakdown the problem and try to think laterally.

###3. Field Related Questions###

These questions are absolutely relevant for any technical role. Can you imagine being hired as a design engineer without going through an interview with no assessment of your skills. You could of lied in your resume, and no one would of known any better.

Like it or not, I think it needs to be done.

Here is a quick list of some tech positions experienced by myself and from friends and what sort of questions to expect during this process:

**Software Engineer**

    - Writing code on the whiteboard / paper
    - Basic Algorithms i.e. Time complexity, recursion, trees, graphs etc.
    - Desk checking (code analysis)
    - Familiarity with scripting
    
**Hardware Engineer (Electronics)**

    - Basic circuit analysis
    - Basic circuit design
    - Logic design fundamentals
    - VHDL
    - Familiarity with EDA software

**System Administrator**

    - Familiarity with scripting
    - OS (Unix, Linux, Windows)
    - Platform tools
    - Network admin

This list is far from exhausted, but just gives you a head start on what to expect.

Preparation wise, brush up on the specific areas the potential role is likely to perform. For example, if you’re likely going to be designing and developing software for low latency systems, be sure to know your languages and algorithms to a certain degree. Even if it means going back to your uni notes way back when…just do it as a refresher, or even by going through some of your previous work. It won’t kill you. Every little form of prep work counts so take some initiative and make sure you’re primed and ready for interview day.

From previous experience, technical job applications typically go through a series of multiple stages, which can range from sequential interviews onsite to a combination of phone and face-to-face arrangements, so, make sure that you adequately prepare for each stage.

Finally, be positive and be prepared for anything. Your interviewers are more willing to give you a better shot at the job if you demonstrate some enthusiasm and humour.

Be confident, be prepared and be enthusiastic.
