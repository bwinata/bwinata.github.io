## Attending My First Hackathon ##

**25-26 May 2013 – Sydney, Australia**

You know that website called ‘Meetup’ right? The one where you can find and join really cool local groups in your area sharing your common interests. Yup…that one. Well anyways, I got an email around May 2013 broadcasting that a hackathon was to be held in Sydney between May 25 – 26 at Fishburners, Ultimo. For those who aren’t Sydney siders, it’s just located on the outskirts of our CBD. This particular hackathon was to be hosted by AngelHack.

For those who aren’t really familiar with what a Hackathon is all about, it’s basically a two-day event, usually spanning over the weekend where hobbyists, coders, enthusiasts and idea generators come together to develop anything they want. Websites and mobile apps are the usual and obvious outcomes, but in some cases hardware can get built as well. So you basically “hack” your way through the weekend developing whatever it is, be it in a group or by yourself. At the end of the event, the winner(s) are declared and everybody goes home.

Okay so back to the event.

I’ve never been to any of these things before, but I’ve heard that they’re a great place to test out your coding skills and meet new people. Now, believe me when I say that my coding skills are not the greatest by far (I’m still learning). But I guess I was interested in attending because I wanted to see what all the fuss was about, drink beer (free), meet new people and long-shot – maybe create a startup (I think I was a bit too ambitious). So anyhoo, I paid the registration fee and off I went.

### Preparation ###

There is none.

Actually, I’m kidding. I was quite surprised in fact to find out through my Googling of other hackathons and blogs that a considerable amount of time is placed into preparing for such an event, if you want to do well that is. I found that in order to get a good head start, make sure that you have the right tools at your disposable. After all there was a reason why it was called a HACKathon – you find every means to build, create, design and develop your app as quickly as possible. So that’s exactly what I did.

Here are some really cool tools I used for the event:

**[Foundation | Zurb](http://foundation.zurb.com)**

A really neat CSS framework that you can use to spruce up and quickly build a nice looking web page in a matter of minutes. It provides you with icons, columns, example code and JavaScript animations.

**[CodeIgniter](http://ellislab.com/codeigniter)**

My first server language was PHP and I found it a really good language to learn for beginners. For those who can’t get enough of it, CodeIgniter is one of the many frameworks available in helping your write PHP applications fast. It provides an OO design methodology which makes your code well structured, easy to ready and quick to test.

**[Git / GitHub](http://github.com)**

Let me just say this. Know matter how good you think you are in coding or how well your is code is written, there will always be changes you will have to make and there ways things can go wrong. Remember Murphy’s law – Anything that can go wrong will go wrong. You could be in the middle of finishing off your app and find out that your hard drive just crapped itself. What happens then?

Word to the wise. Always ensure that you maintain some type of version control in place be it CVS, SVN, Git, Perforce etc. I choose Git.

Git is amazingly fast because it operates under a Distributed Version Control System (DVCS). With GitHub, you create a free account and from there, allowed to upload your project onto their cloud. Projects are shareable or can be made private (I think you have to pay a fee).

Git does take some getting use to, but never fear…there is plenty of documentation out there in Google land. Also, if you’re not the command-line type, nice looking and user friendly programs are available to do the pushing and pulling for you, for Windows, Mac and Linux.

**[Aptana Studio](http://aptana.com)**

Now I know that a lot of my friends and colleagues (those who are the hard core coders) will say that text editors (emacs, vim) are the way to go for speed, convenience and execution, but I find that IDEs are really good and Aptana is one of them. It was initially meant for Linux being an open-source project, but has finally made its way onto Windows.

With really nice colour schemes, friendly Git management, nice deployment facility and auto complete, it’s the IDE I would definitely recommend for web dev. The look and feel is just awesome and I encourage everyone to at least give it a go.

**[Firebug](http://getfirebug.com)**

A really great tool to debug your web app in Firefox. It lets you debug problems ranging from JS to MySQL, CSS and HTML.

**[LAMP](http://http://www.wikihow.com/Build-a-LAMP-Server) / [WAMP](http://www.wampserver.com/en/%E2%80%8E)**

The Linux / Windows, Apache, MysQL and PHP (LAMP / WAMP) server is a fantastic little tool to get your development off the ground without having to setup an actual domain on the web. Its purpose is to let you test your app before you bring it live, by setting up a local Apache server on your local machine. Easy to setup and plenty of documentation. I found this tool absolutely invaluable as a testbed for quick and dirty hacks as well as proper development.

**[JS Fiddle](http://jsfiddle.net) / [JS Bin](http://jsbin.com)**

If you’re keen just to try out a little piece of Javascript code, whether it be testing out an animation, trying to test out button clicks and message handlers…whatever, then this is for you! An online testbed where you can mock up simple pieces of HTML, CSS and JS code anytime, anywhere!

Well there you go! My prep work is done. It’s time to head off to the event.


###Saturday 25 May 2013###
**9:00 AM**

On the first day, I rocked up to the event and found that hardly anyone was there. Awkward! Although there was free breakfast available and coffee, who was I to complain. Soon afterwards, a bunch of other people wandered in and by 10:00AM the entire place was packed. I have to admit though that at first, I was pretty reluctant to approach anyone thinking that I was in the wrong crowd, or I lacked the ability to convey my thoughts in an articulate manner. But it soon dawned upon me (around 30 seconds later to be precise) that the whole reason for joining this event was to meet people, and if I didn’t take the initiative, I might as well have just gone home and went back to sleep (ahhhhh sleep…how I would be missing you for the next 48 hours). So anyway, I decided to get out of my comfort zone instead and begin speaking to different people and I have to say that it was a great atmosphere, and after speaking to quite a few people from design, software, marketing and business backgrounds, I knew I was going to be in good stead for the rest of the event.

**10:30 AM**

At exactly 10:32 AM, an announcement was made that pitching would start imminently. Okay, so the idea behind pitching is when anyone with an idea has the opportunity to come up to the stage and tell everyone about their idea within 1 minute. Now, the pitcher can ask who they want and what they need and it’s basically up to them to inspire and influence others to work with them on their project.

I was sort on the fence of being a pitcher, mainly because I didn’t really know how people would take my idea and whether also I could fit everything I wanted to say in one minute. But long story short, I went to the front and gave it my all. In all honesty, it wasn’t very concise and too quickly spoken. It was something I had to definitely improve and develop over time, but in the end it was great to get up and let others know about what you had to offer.

Pitching went on for around 30 minutes, with some really great ideas being put forward.

**11:15 AM**

Immediately afterwards, it was time to mingle again, grab some quick brunch and most importantly start forming groups. I was very surprised to speak to a few people interested in my idea albeit being delivered from a far then perfect pitch, but yes…people liked the idea! But quite reluctantly, I declined their offer to join not because of what they had to offer, but simply due to the fact that my idea had already gone substantial development prior to the event. I somewhat felt obligated to pursue an idea completely from scratch to make it fair and maybe work on something new and fresh.

I therefore decided to join another team. Interestingly enough, one of the very members of that team had initially approached me about my idea. I loved their idea – an app where you were able to locate local events in your area by leveraging data from Facebook and other social media networks. It was a good initiative and would give me the opportunity to get my hands dirty in mobile development – something that I hadn’t really dealt with before.

It was now around 12:10 PM, so away we went, the three of us. Went up the stairs, found a really cool looking boardroom just for us and settled in for the next 24 hours.

And away we go…

At first, we decided to prep ourselves by doing a bit of brainstorming on the idea and its execution. How I freaking love you whiteboard markers.

What came out of it was:

- Basic requirements analysis

- Schedule and milestones

- Wireframes

- Flowcharts

Everything we needed to get started!

Now as I mentioned previously, mobile development was fair to say not my forte. Thankfully, another member was in the same boat. He kindly suggested using PhoneGap (add that to the list of prep tools!) – an awesome environment where you’re able to create mobile apps for pretty much any platform (Android, iOS, Black Berry) using web languages i.e. HTML, CSS, JavaScript etc. It was definitely a hit – quick to download and easy to learn.

From there, we decided to divvy up the tasks – front / back end. Another team member and myself worked on the look and feel (front) while the other worked on the back i.e. Facebook / Google maps API integration.

**5:30 PM**

I needed a break. At that point we were doing well, so I decided to grab another coffee (I think it was my 3rd) downstairs and see how the others team were going. It was buzzing! Everyone was cracking along with their tasks, more some than others. I spoke to a few people I met earlier in the day about their progress and they were surprisingly very open about their project – frameworks, languages etc. We chatted for awhile then headed back upstairs.

**8:00 PM**

Dinner time. Enough said.

**10:00 PM**

Coffee.

**1:00 AM**

Progress update – A rudimentary interface was developed, while various public events could be fetched from Facebook around a specified area. The core functionality had been created, but we were far from finished with further development required on the user interface and integration of the back end.

FYI the coffee helped.

I have to say that there were quite a few times where frustration would creep in and would stall me for a good hour or so, and what I found was that actually talking about your problem to your team members and even other groups really helped. Take a 5-10 min breather and you’ll be alright.

**6:00 AM**

Need sleep! One hour nap should do it.

**7:30 AM**

Damn it!

**8:30 AM**

Breakfast! Thank God! and coffee.

**9:00 AM**

At this point, everyone was pretty tired. But thankfully, we were nearly there. We all knew that the deadline to meet was 12:00 PM. So we made it a goal to get everything into version control, uploaded onto hackathon.io and registered by 11:00 – 11:30.

**11:45 AM**

Ummm yeah…that wasn’t suppose to happen.

Anyways, never fear because everything was nearly done, a few remaining tweaks needed to be made.

**12:00 PM**

BOOM!

We didn’t complete everything we anticipated, but at the end of the day we were all pleased with what had developed over the course of 24 hours, albeit red-eyed.

The rest of it…

The rest of the afternoon was dedicated to presentation and judging (two rounds)

Each group was required to demonstrate their app to a panel of 2-3 judges during the first round. If successful, that group would proceed to the next round where their presentation would be in front of the cohort.

Unfortunately we didn’t win that day, but seriously…who cares! It was an amazing experience.

I achieved exactly what I set out to do. I had the chance of networking with amazing people and had the experience of writing an app within the space of 24 hours that will undoubtedly improve my coding ability and most importantly created friendships along the way.

Now bed!
