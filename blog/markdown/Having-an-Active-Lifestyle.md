##Having (Well Trying ...) an Active Lifestyle##

**20 August 2013 – Sydney, Australia**

I sometimes get the feeling that I can’t be stuffed at all doing anything, especially if it’s after work, previously uni. I just feel that something has just sucked the life out of me and anything fairly active that I envisioned to do before the day’s end has quickly evaporated.

During my past uni days, being active was fair to say, played a moderate part in my lifestyle. Playing a few rounds of table-tennis, hitting some pool down at the local uni bar and going for jogs around campus were all great activities for the first couple of years. It was a great opportunity to socialise as well as burn those unwanted calories from eating Turkish pides and kebabs all day long. However as the semesters passed away and uni got a whole lot more intense, I found it more challenging to stick with this active routine and begun to fallback into a lifestyle plagued with sleepless nights (home and campus), cheap and convenient fast food and pure laziness. I felt my energy levels fall and my waist expand. Despite all this, I was completely aware of what was happening, but I guess I subconsciously pushed any thought of getting back into shape out of my mind. My entire focus was placed on finishing my degree and most importantly my thesis. Retrospectively, having had time to reflect on past events, the conclusion was that  things could of been much better and I became aware of the damage I was causing to both my mind and body.  It was definitely time to re-think my priorities and get my health back on track.

After beginning work the following year, I made it a mission to get back to my active routine of exercise. It was challenging at first but eventually I got back into shape as I had imagined. Despite all of what has happened, in hind sight, the trap of falling into such an abyss (okay well not so extreme) could of been averted if a few simple changes were made to my lifestyle.

By following these few simple techniques and keeping to them on a regular basis, I found that my energy levels were more consistent throughout the day, I was more focus during daily activities and I just felt generally much better.

**1. Try To Grab Some Exercise**

It’s not easy for anyone to start an exercise regime, but if you take small steps in getting into the habit of a little bit of activity you’ll become more motivated to do anything.

Sign up to the gym, go for a jog after and / or before work, do a bit of swimming during the summer break, pick up some tennis or squash over the weekend. Whatever it may be, do it with someone who you’ll know will motivate yourself to be consistent and diligent (vice-versa).

Doing a bit of physical activity on a regular basis, will go a long way!

**2. Do Some Walking**

If I have some time during work, I take a stroll around work, grab a coffee or go down to the local shopping centre to grab a bite with a colleague / friend. Doing a bit of walking really does help by taking your mind off things and gives you space to grab some fresh air and takes the edge off your busy tasks.

**3. Have A Sleep Routine**

In all honesty, I must say that I haven’t always been the most diligent and punctual person when it comes to sleep. Some days I may get 5 hours of sleep while others, heading to bed around 10 PM will do it for me. Having an inconsistent sleep routine can really stuff you the next day – extreme fatigue, sleepy afternoons, reduced focus…and the list goes on.  Since then, I’ve tried to maintain a regular sleeping pattern, spanning approximately 7-8 hours a night.

Do it! Your day will be so much better.

**4. Eat Something Healthy (If you can)**

Trying to eat something healthy at least once a day will definitely help, and try to stick to a consistent routine of meals. Don’t get me wrong, I enjoy the occasional fast food binge, but too much of a good thing is a bad thing (in some cases). It’ll make you feel a whole lot much better and a little less bloated than usual.

**5. Maintain A Balance**

When I’m in the middle of doing a task, trying to meet a deadline, confused, frustrated, stressed out, focused and all of the above, I feel extremely reluctant to do anything else other than that particular task. I get the urge and the motivation to finish off that task at all costs, placing other things on hold. For example, if I’ve set the day to go for a jog after work, and I find myself in the position of meeting a deadline, then the latter wins. Don’t get me wrong, sometimes these things happen and for the sake of the project or your company, sacrifices have to be made. But when these things start to become consistent, it’s a sign that something has gone off the rails.

Be sure to keep track of what your sacrificing at the expense of other activities. I now try to make an effort to maintain a balance between work and my lifestyle. Don’t let it get to the point where you begin missing friend’s and family events on the count of work. Nothing should be more important in your life than your health, friends and family. Remember to take a breather and do something else.

Keeping to these 5 simple tips has really helped me gain a better perspective on life and allowed me to appreciate what is really important.

Nothing should stand in the way of you being healthy and having that active lifestyle. Give it a try, because it will work and you’ll be feeling a whole lot more better inside and out.
